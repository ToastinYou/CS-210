SNHU CS-210 Programming Languages

The goal of this project is to digest data from a file and produce results based on that information.
More specifically, it reads a list of items that sold at a grocery store and does a couple of things:
- Organizes a list of the items, showing how many times each item sold.
- Allows the user to search for how many times a specific item was sold.
- Produces a text-based histogram of how many times each item was sold.

In this program I did a good job of providing an easy-to-use input/output menu and handling code exceptions.
My code could have been organized better if I spent more time on it, there is a lot of code in the main function.
The hardest was reading the information from the file. This process is intricate and can vary greatly depending on what information is in the file.
Actively writing code comments and following standards and guidelines helped make the code easily readable.
